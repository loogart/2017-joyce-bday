                <p>You are always there for me and Bowser. You are always there for your family and mine. You put your loved ones before yourself. You are incredible and I thank God for putting you on this Earth. What? I am married to you? Wow, I am a lucky bastard to be with you. Check out these moments that remind me of how incredible it is to be with you. Remember what I said a while ago: "JACKPOT!"</p>

Since we are in Montreal, why not drop by for a show at the Just for Laughs Festival that combines both? The Mozart Group is the way to go!
